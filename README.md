# Webdesign_Kattis

Kattis is a mockup online shop that I created from scratch, from idea generation, logo design, creation of graphic profile, a wireframe, a mockup to an actual website. This project was more foused on the design part with Photoshop and Illustrator rather than functional coding, so the webapge has only a homepage and a contact page, and it is not as interactive as my other project.

This project were designed with Photoshop and Illustrator and built with ReactJS.
